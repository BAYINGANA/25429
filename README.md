# Logging in Java: Assignment Overview  

### 1. What is Logging?  
Logging is the process of recording information about the execution of a program. It helps developers understand the program's behavior, diagnose problems, and track various events during runtime.  

### 2. Why Logging is Important  
- **Debugging**: Helps developers identify and fix issues by providing insights into the application's behavior during execution.  
- **Monitoring**: Allows for the observation of application performance and helps detect anomalies in real-time or through historical data analysis.  
- **Auditing**: Maintains records of system activities, which can be crucial for security and compliance.  
- **Customer Support**: Provides useful information about user interactions and system performance, aiding in future enhancements.  

### 3. Understanding Logging Levels  
Logging levels include:  
- **DEBUG**: Used for detailed diagnostic output. Typically only enabled in development.  
- **INFO**: General informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.  
- **WARN**: Indicators of potential problems or suspicious actions that are not immediately problematic.  
- **ERROR**: Detailed error messages that indicate something went wrong.  
- **FATAL**: Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.  

## Practical Implementation  
The practical part of this assignment includes:  
### 4. Setting Up a Logger in Java  
   - Create a logger instance using Java's built-in logging framework (e.g., `java.util.logging` or `Log4j`).  

### 5. Configuring Output Destinations  
   - Configure the logger to output log messages to various destinations such as the console, files, or remote logging servers.  

### 6. Formatting Log Messages  
   - Implement custom formatting for log messages to include timestamps, logging levels, and contextual information for better readability.
